# Chess
Chess is a board game for two players, called White and Black, each controlling an army of chess pieces, with the objective to checkmate the opponent's king

I split my whole program into 3 modules,  Board, Piece, Main ,  I wrote most of my functions in Board, I need to refactor and make the more more cleaner, I wrote around 32 tests for my chess game as well
